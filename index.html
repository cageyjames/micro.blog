			 <p>Data formats play a fundamental role in software development and data management, influencing how information is stored, shared, and analyzed. While some formats endure due to their efficiency and adaptability, others persist despite technological advancements, often lingering as legacy artifacts within various industries.</p>
<p>With way too many years of experience working with both spatial and non-spatial data, I have encountered a vast array of file formats—each with its strengths, limitations, and occasional frustrations.</p>
<p>In this five-part blog series, I will explore my five preferred file formats, examining the factors that have contributed to their longevity, their relevance in modern workflows, and the lessons they offer for the future of data management.</p>
<p>First off, the most popular database in the world, Microsoft Excel.</p>
<p><em><strong>Excel: The Ubiquitous Spreadsheet That Endures</strong></em>
<strong>Introduction: The Unshakable Dominance of Excel</strong>
Few software tools have achieved the longevity and ubiquity of Microsoft Excel. Since its introduction in the 1980s, Excel has become an indispensable tool across industries, used by financial analysts, project managers, scientists, and even GIS professionals—despite its fundamental limitations as a database or spatial data format.
While modern cloud platforms, relational databases, and specialized analytics tools have reshaped data management, Excel persists. It remains the default choice for millions, not necessarily because it is the most sophisticated tool for the job, but because it is accessible, familiar, and highly adaptable.
Yet, with its versatility comes a set of well-documented pitfalls. From data corruption caused by automatic formatting to inefficiencies in managing large datasets, Excel often creates as many challenges as it solves. This post examines why Excel remains an essential tool, explores its misapplications in data management—particularly in geospatial workflows—and offers best practices for using it effectively in a modern data environment.
<strong>The Accidental GIS: How Excel Became a Spatial Data Format</strong>
Excel was never designed to handle spatial data, yet it continues to be used as a GIS tool in environments where dedicated spatial databases or platforms are unavailable—or where users lack familiarity with them. The result is a widespread misuse of Excel as an informal GIS system, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and compatibility issues.
Common Misuses of Excel in Spatial Data Management	1.	Storing Coordinate Data Without Standardization	•	Latitude and longitude values are often stored in separate columns, but inconsistencies arise when formats vary—some datasets use decimal degrees, while others mix degrees, minutes, and seconds.	•	Fields are frequently mislabeled (Lat, Long, X, Y), sometimes reversed, and often contain text entries that disrupt automated processing.	2.	Mixing Data Types in a Single Column	•	A column meant for numerical coordinates may contain a mix of numbers, text entries (“N/A”), or empty cells, leading to inaccuracies when processed in other systems.	3.	Manually Performing Spatial Joins	•	Instead of using spatial databases or GIS tools to join datasets based on geographic relationships, some professionals resort to copying and pasting between Excel tabs, increasing the risk of human error.
<strong>Why Excel Persists in Spatial Workflows</strong>
Despite its shortcomings, Excel is often chosen for GIS-related tasks because:	•	It is universally available—virtually every organization uses it.	•	It allows for quick, ad-hoc analysis without requiring specialized GIS knowledge.	•	It integrates easily with other software, making it a convenient intermediary between data sources.
However, these advantages do not negate its limitations, particularly when handling complex spatial data.
<strong>The Strengths of Excel: Why It Remains Essential</strong>
For all its inefficiencies, Excel possesses unique qualities that contribute to its enduring relevance. These characteristics make it particularly useful for quick analyses and lightweight data management.</p>
<ol>
<li>Universal Adoption and Ease of Use
Few software tools have achieved Excel’s level of adoption. Even users with limited technical expertise can sort, filter, and manipulate data without requiring specialized training, making it a go-to solution for data organization.</li>
<li>Pivot Tables and Instant Data Visualization
Excel’s pivot tables enable users to quickly summarize large datasets, creating insights without writing complex SQL queries or developing custom reports. Similarly, built-in charting and visualization tools provide immediate graphical representations of data.</li>
<li>Portability and Flexibility
Excel files are easily shared via email, cloud storage, or messaging platforms. Unlike databases or APIs that require configuration, an Excel file is a self-contained dataset that can be opened and edited anywhere.</li>
<li>Integration with Other Tools
From Power BI to GIS software like ArcGIS and QGIS, Excel is widely supported across platforms, serving as an intermediary format for various workflows.
<strong>The Challenges of Using Excel for Data Management</strong>
While Excel’s strengths have made it indispensable, its limitations have led to countless inefficiencies and errors in data management.</li>
<li>Automatic Formatting Corrupts Data
Excel automatically reformats certain types of data, often without user input. This is particularly problematic for:	•	Postal codes (e.g., “00501” is converted to “501”)	•	Dates (e.g., “2024-02-01” becomes “Feb 1, 2024” or a different format entirely)	•	Scientific notation for long numbers (e.g., large numerical IDs are converted into exponent notation)
Such transformations, while seemingly minor, can corrupt datasets, especially when exported to other systems.</li>
<li>Lack of Version Control and Data Integrity
Without a structured version control system, Excel files are often duplicated, edited by multiple users, and renamed inconsistently. This results in confusion and errors, with multiple conflicting versions of the same dataset circulating within an organization.	•	&ldquo;Data_Final.xlsx&rdquo;	•	&ldquo;Data_Final_v2.xlsx&rdquo;	•	&ldquo;Data_Final_v2_UPDATED.xlsx&rdquo;	•	&ldquo;Data_FINAL(REAL).xlsx&rdquo;
This lack of control frequently leads to discrepancies in reporting and decision-making.</li>
<li>Performance Limitations on Large Datasets
While Excel is efficient for datasets with thousands of rows, performance degrades significantly when handling hundreds of thousands or millions of records. Large files become slow, formulas take longer to compute, and crashes become common.
For truly large-scale data management, SQL databases, cloud-based analytics tools, or big data frameworks offer far more robust solutions.</li>
<li>Poor Support for Multi-User Collaboration
Despite improvements in Excel Online, the traditional desktop version struggles with real-time collaboration. Without proper locking mechanisms or role-based access control, simultaneous edits can lead to data overwrites or inconsistencies.
<strong>Using Excel Responsibly</strong>
Given Excel’s strengths and weaknesses, it is best used as an analytical tool rather than a primary data management solution. Here are best practices to mitigate common pitfalls:</li>
<li>Disable Autoformatting
While you don&rsquo;t have control over every file, yo prevent Excel from modifying data, adjust settings in:File → Options → Proofing → AutoCorrect Options</li>
<li>Convert Data into Tables for Consistency
Using the Table feature (Ctrl + T on Windows, Cmd + T on Mac) ensures structured, reliable sorting and filtering.</li>
<li>Store Long-Term Data in Databases, Not Excel
For mission-critical data, store records in SQL databases, cloud-based systems, or version-controlled repositories. Excel should be used for analysis, not storage.  Easy enough to get the data out, you should as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Use Excel Only for Small-Scale Spatial Data Workflows
As mentioned, nothing in Excel is spatially aware.  If handling geospatial data, consider GeoJSON, PostGIS, or even Shapefiles for structured, spatially-aware datasets.<br>
<strong>Conclusion: The Enduring Relevance of Excel</strong>
Despite its challenges, Excel remains an essential tool across industries. Its widespread adoption, ease of use, and versatility make it indispensable—even as more sophisticated data management solutions continue to emerge.
However, responsible usage is key. Excel should not replace databases, GIS platforms, or cloud-based analytics tools, but it can serve as a valuable intermediary for data analysis and reporting. By understanding its limitations and applying best practices, professionals can maximize its utility while avoiding its common pitfalls.
What’s Next?
In the next installment of this series, I will examine the format that was introduced in the mid-90s, another enduring data structure that, despite its limitations, continues to be widely used in geospatial applications.</li>

			<h1><a href="https://jamesfee.org/2024/09/25/leveraging-blockchain-technology.html">Leveraging Blockchain Technology for Enhanced Management of Digital Twins and BIM Models</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://jamesfee.org/2024/09/25/leveraging-blockchain-technology.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-09-25 12:15:04 -0700">Sep 25, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>As the digital transformation of industries accelerates, the management of Digital Twins and Building Information Models (BIM) has emerged as a critical challenge. These models are fundamental in sectors such as construction, urban planning, and facility management, providing detailed representations of physical assets and enabling advanced simulations and analyses. However, the complexity of these models, coupled with the involvement of multiple stakeholders, presents significant challenges in maintaining data integrity, managing derivative works, and ensuring the enforcement of contracts.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology offers a powerful solution to these challenges by providing a secure, decentralized, and transparent system for managing Digital Twins and BIM models. Here’s how blockchain can revolutionize this space:
<strong>Data Integrity and Security</strong>:   - <strong>Example</strong>: Consider a large-scale infrastructure project involving a Digital Twin of a smart city. The model needs to be frequently updated with data from various sensors, construction teams, and urban planners. With blockchain, every update to the Digital Twin is recorded on an immutable ledger, ensuring that the data remains consistent and secure over time. This prevents unauthorized changes, ensuring that all stakeholders can trust the data’s accuracy and reliability.   - <strong>Benefit</strong>: Blockchain’s decentralized ledger makes it nearly impossible for any single entity to alter the data without detection, significantly reducing the risk of data tampering and ensuring that the Digital Twin remains a trustworthy source of information throughout the project lifecycle.
<strong>Provenance and Traceability</strong>:   - <strong>Example</strong>: In the development of a new commercial building, the BIM model undergoes multiple iterations, with contributions from architects, engineers, and contractors. Blockchain enables each modification to the model to be logged with a timestamp and the identity of the contributor. If a design flaw is later discovered, stakeholders can trace back through the blockchain to identify who made each change, when it was made, and the rationale behind it.   - <strong>Benefit</strong>: This level of traceability ensures accountability and transparency, allowing project managers to easily audit the development process and maintain a clear history of the model’s evolution. It also simplifies the process of compliance with regulatory requirements by providing an unalterable record of the model’s development.
<strong>Smart Contracts and Licensing</strong>:   - <strong>Example</strong>: Imagine a scenario where a BIM model is used by multiple subcontractors for different aspects of a construction project. Each contractor needs access to specific parts of the model under certain licensing agreements. With blockchain, smart contracts can automatically enforce these agreements—granting access only to authorized users and ensuring that usage complies with the predefined terms. For instance, a smart contract could be set to automatically release payment when a subcontractor completes a specific task using the BIM model, and this action would be recorded on the blockchain.   - <strong>Benefit</strong>: Smart contracts streamline the enforcement of licensing and usage agreements, reducing the administrative burden on project managers and ensuring compliance without the need for manual oversight. This automation also reduces the risk of legal disputes by ensuring that all parties adhere to the agreed-upon terms.
<strong>Collaboration and Version Control</strong>:   - <strong>Example</strong>: In a complex project like the construction of a new transportation hub, multiple teams—ranging from civil engineers to environmental consultants—need to collaborate on the BIM model. Blockchain facilitates this by providing a single, shared ledger where every change to the model is recorded and visible to all authorized parties. If an engineer updates the model with new structural data, this update is immediately available to the entire team, and the blockchain ensures that the change is properly recorded and cannot be overwritten without consensus.   - <strong>Benefit</strong>: This approach eliminates version conflicts and ensures that all stakeholders are working from the most up-to-date data. It fosters a more collaborative environment by enabling secure, transparent sharing of information across teams, reducing the likelihood of errors and rework.
<strong>Conclusion</strong>:
The integration of blockchain technology into the management of Digital Twins and BIM models provides a robust solution to some of the most pressing challenges in the construction and infrastructure sectors. By ensuring data integrity, enhancing traceability, automating contract enforcement, and improving collaboration, blockchain not only addresses current challenges but also paves the way for new opportunities in project management and digital asset management. As industries continue to adopt digital technologies, blockchain’s role in managing the complex lifecycle of Digital Twins and BIM models will become increasingly vital.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781801073974">Hands-On Azure Digital Twins: A practical guide to building distributed IoT solutions</a> by Alexander Meijers 📚</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working with Digital Twins for almost 10 years and as simple as the concept is, ontologies get in the way of implementations. The big deal is how can you implement, how does one actually create a digital twin and deploy it to your users.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest though, the Azure Digital Twin service/product is complex and requires a ton of work. It isn&rsquo;t an upload CAD drawing and connect some data sources. In this case Meijers does a great job of walking through how to get started. But it isn&rsquo;t for beginners, you&rsquo;ll need to have previous experience with Azure Cloud services, Microsoft Visual Studio and the ability to debug code. But if you&rsquo;ve got even a general understand of this, the walk throughs are detailed enough to learn the idiosyncrasies of the Azure Digital Twin process.</p>
<p>The book does take you through the process of understanding what an Azure Digital Twin model is, how to upload them, developing relationships between models and how to query them. After you have an understanding on this, Meijers dives into connecting the model to services, updating the Azure Digital Twin models and then connecting to Microsoft Azure Maps to view the model on maps. Finally he showcases how these Digital Twins can become smart buildings which is the hopeful outcome of doing all the work.</p>
<p>The book has a lot of code examples and ability to download it all from a Github repository. Knowledge of JSON and JavaScript, Python and .NET or Java is probably required. BUT, even if you don&rsquo;t know how to code, this book is a good introduction to Azure Digital Twins. While there are pages of code examples, Meijers does a good job of explaining the how and why you would use Azure Digital Twins. If you&rsquo;re interesting in how you can use a hosted Digital Twin service that is managed by a cloud service, this is a great resource.</p>
<p>I felt like I knew Azure Digital Twins before reading this book, but it taught me a lot about how and why Microsoft did what they did with the service. Many aspects that caused me to scratch my head became clearer to me and I felt like this book gave me additional background that I didn&rsquo;t have before. This book requires an understanding of programming but after finishing it I felt like Meijers' ability to describe the process outside of code makes the book well worth it to anyone who wants to understand the concept and architecture of Azure Digital Twins.</p>
<p>Thoroughly enjoyed the book.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>JPEG took advantage of various compression tricks to dramatically shrink images compared to other formats like GIF. The latest version of glTF similarly takes advantage of techniques for compressing both geometry of 3D objects and their textures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I actually like this analogy.  Consider what <a href="https://spatiallyadjusted.com/open-environments-and-digital-twins/">I said 2 years ago</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is widely supported these days but it really isn’t a great format for BIM models or other digital twin layers because it is more of a visual format than a data storage model. Think of it similar to a JPEG, great for final products, but you don’t want to work with it for your production data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://technical.buildingsmart.org/standards/ifc/">IFC</a> is a much better format for Digital Twins but glTF does a great job with interoperability and storage.  Much like you might want to store GIS data in a Geodatabase and share a map with JPEG, you should store your data in IFC and share as glTF.</p>

<p>I told him all that matters is he spends time on Python.  I&rsquo;ve already exposed him to it when his major was Biology, but I would wager it means even more for GIS.

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how to start sharing content again.  I have a couple ways in the past but they are all disjointed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.spatiallyadjusted.com">Spatially Adjusted</a> - my blog I&rsquo;ve been posting to since 2005.  I feel like has done what it needed to do and I need to move on.  Great content, but that&rsquo;s not how I work anymore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://spatialtau.spatiallyadjusted.com">Spatial Tau</a> - my newsletter.  I&rsquo;ve been hot and cold with this, I have some of the best reactions from people about it, but I don&rsquo;t like the interface.  I <em>could</em> move people over here but I don&rsquo;t know if that is the best solution.  Maybe content is needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Podcasts - I&rsquo;ve had a couple; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Yvo5bLRe17RR0nNvy6L0Q">Hangouts with James Fee</a>, Cageyjames and Geobabbler are probably the two biggest ones.  I just haven&rsquo;t had time to edit a podcast anymore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.twitter.com/cageyjames">Twitter</a> - @cageyjames&hellip; enough said</p>
<p>I backed micro.blog years ago on Kickstarter and I&rsquo;ve liked the interface, so maybe this is where I&rsquo;ll try and post now.  I reserve the right to change my mind.</p>
