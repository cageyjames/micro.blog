			 <p><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/05/11/why-gltf-is-the-jpeg-for-the-metaverse-and-digital-twins/">Why glTF is the JPEG for the metaverse and digital twins</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>JPEG took advantage of various compression tricks to dramatically shrink images compared to other formats like GIF. The latest version of glTF similarly takes advantage of techniques for compressing both geometry of 3D objects and their textures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I actually like this analogy.  Consider what <a href="https://spatiallyadjusted.com/open-environments-and-digital-twins/">I said 2 years ago</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is widely supported these days but it really isn‚Äôt a great format for BIM models or other digital twin layers because it is more of a visual format than a data storage model. Think of it similar to a JPEG, great for final products, but you don‚Äôt want to work with it for your production data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://technical.buildingsmart.org/standards/ifc/">IFC</a> is a much better format for Digital Twins but glTF does a great job with interoperability and storage.  Much like you might want to store GIS data in a Geodatabase and share a map with JPEG, you should store your data in IFC and share as glTF.</p>

			 <p>Funny how when you start talking about something, it triggers some other thing.  Well in a discussion about SpaceX with friends, I began to think about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Research_Maps">TerraServer</a>.  I couldn&rsquo;t remember what happened to it, but of course <a href="https://spatiallyadjusted.com/microsoft-terraserver-is-no-more/">I blogged about it</a> over 10 years ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In its time, I used it to test WMS, but I‚Äôm not sure I ever really used it for anything else. Much like LandSat, I‚Äôll shed no tears. It served its purpose and now it must die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OUCH!  Boy, I hope when I go I get a better eulogy.  I don&rsquo;t think I was being completely fair about TerraServer.  I mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Gray_(computer_scientist)">Jim Gray</a>, scaling SQL Server on Windows NT, how could one not geek out.  I used to be very hard to get access to open data and TerraServer did bring a ton of imagery data to users.</p>
<p>I mean unpack <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-microsoft-terraservertm/">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The TerraServer demonstrates the scalability of Microsoft‚Äôs Windows NT Server and SQL Server running on Compaq AlphaServer 8400 and StorageWorks‚Ñ¢ hardware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s the world it grew up in. Cheers TerraServer! üó∫</p>

			 <p>I was just thinking about the iPod today and how it used to be such a critical part of my life.  Now not only do I not use an iPod but I don&rsquo;t even buy my music anymore, just use <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>.  But back then, fitting all my music on an iPod was amazing.</p>
<p>The last iPod I ever bought was this one, an iPod nano 7th generation.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I bought it for my wedding back in 2015.  I wanted to make sure our song for the first dance was not screwed up and I had zero faith the band could manage it without something as simple as an iPod.  Because engraving was free, I added this touch.</p>

<p>It ended up being true. üé∂</p>

			 <p>This spring, my son changed his major to GIS.  He almost did Geography, but I was able to convince him these computers are going to take off eventually and he needs to have something more modern.  He&rsquo;s finished up his first semester and he says he loves it. We&rsquo;ll see!</p>
<p>I told him all that matters is he spends time on Python.  I&rsquo;ve already exposed him to it when his major was Biology, but I would wager it means even more for GIS.  He starts some of these classes this fall so I can&rsquo;t wait to see what they are teaching him at Arizona State&rsquo;s <a href="https://sgsup.asu.edu">School of Geographical Sciences &amp; Urban Planning</a>.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how to start sharing content again.  I have a couple ways in the past but they are all disjointed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.spatiallyadjusted.com">Spatially Adjusted</a> - my blog I&rsquo;ve been posting to since 2005.  I feel like has done what it needed to do and I need to move on.  Great content, but that&rsquo;s not how I work anymore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://spatialtau.spatiallyadjusted.com">Spatial Tau</a> - my newsletter.  I&rsquo;ve been hot and cold with this, I have some of the best reactions from people about it, but I don&rsquo;t like the interface.  I <em>could</em> move people over here but I don&rsquo;t know if that is the best solution.  Maybe content is needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Podcasts - I&rsquo;ve had a couple; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Yvo5bLRe17RR0nNvy6L0Q">Hangouts with James Fee</a>, Cageyjames and Geobabbler are probably the two biggest ones.  I just haven&rsquo;t had time to edit a podcast anymore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.twitter.com/cageyjames">Twitter</a> - @cageyjames&hellip; enough said</p>
<p>I backed micro.blog years ago on Kickstarter and I&rsquo;ve liked the interface, so maybe this is where I&rsquo;ll try and post now.  I reserve the right to change my mind.</p>
