But it isn&rsquo;t for beginners, you&rsquo;ll need to have previous experience with Azure Cloud services, Microsoft Visual Studio and the ability to debug code. But if you&rsquo;ve got even a general understand of this, the walk throughs are detailed enough to learn the idiosyncrasies of the Azure Digital Twin process.</p>\n<p>The book does take you through the process of understanding what an Azure Digital Twin model is, how to upload them, developing relationships between models and how to query them. After you have an understanding on this, Meijers dives into connecting the model to services, updating the Azure Digital Twin models and then connecting to Microsoft Azure Maps to view the model on maps.

He's finished up his first semester and he says he loves it. We'll see!\n\nI told him all that matters is he spends time on Python.  I've already exposed him to it when his major was Biology, but I would wager it means even more for GIS.  He starts some of these classes this fall so I can't wait to see what they are teaching him at Arizona State's [School of Geographical Sciences & Urban Planning](https://sgsup.asu.edu).\n\n🗺\n",
